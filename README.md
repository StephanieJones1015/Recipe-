# Title:
EJ's Recipe Guide

# Purpose:
Welcome to my project. This is a recipe guide that is built for my son, his friends, and other college students to use. The main objective is to provide a fun and quick way to list what ingredients that the user has available and then find a recipe based on those ingredients. The main objective of the project is to encourage my son and other students to be able to save money and possibly eat healthier but providing a way to use what they have available instead of eating out constantly. 

I attempted to use several personalization to encourage the use of the website. I used my son's name in the title as the major personalization to encourage usage. I also added a lot of css details to make it interactive for the users. I used purple and blue colors as accents for the page because those are my son's favorite colors, I emphasized the box shadow for the search input, search button, clear button, and the back button. I also used css to make the search and clear buttons to change shape with rounded edges on all sides when being engaged; all the buttons change color when pressed, and they all move upward. I also used different cursors based on the functionality of the button- the search and random have a wait cursor, while, the clear and back have a pointer cursor. 

# What did I learn:
This was a great learning experience for me. I wanted to add lots of css design elements to engage the user-which will be college students who are more interested in aesthetics than actual function. I also learned a great deal about JavaScript and how to make the syntax work for me in a way that enables the webpage to work as intended.

# Challenges:
There were several challenges for me during this process. I struggled with making the JavaScript work correctly. Primarily the recipe card was a challenge. In styling the card, I had to delete the "hidden" in html which I did not realize initially, for example. The JavaScript to display exactly what I wanted to be shown on each recipe was also a huge struggle for me and I learned a great deal watching numerous videos and reading several sources such as "web development for dummies" to overcome all of these obstacles. Another challenge was making the search input responsive to fit really small mobile devices.
